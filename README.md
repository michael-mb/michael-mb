### Hi Github 👋

Hallo I'm **Michael**, computer science student 💻 and passionate about web development 💪.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on some new projects 😁
- 🤔 I like to develop with Spring and Vue. However I like to discover new tools 🔥

```javascript
let yourCompany = ["your team"];
let me = "Michael";
let match = true;
 
const collaboration = (company, applicant, matching) =>{  
    try {
      if(matching){
        company.push(applicant);
        return `An awesome collaboration is announced between ${company[0]} and ${company[1]} 🤩`;
      }
    } catch (err){
      return `Oh there is an error : ${err} \n Okay ! Let's wish a good continuation 🙂`;
    }  
}

collaboration(yourCompany, me, match)
```
